# ECHO: AI-Powered Civic Grievance Intelligence
A voice-first, AI-powered civic grievance platform that uses Amazon Bedrock and RAG to help citizens navigate public systems and automate legal documentation.

## 💡 Overview
ECHO (Empowering Citizen Help & Outreach) is an AI-native platform designed to bridge the gap between citizens and public systems. By transforming unstructured, multilingual narratives into professional, department-mapped grievances, ECHO ensures that every citizen's voice is heard and processed accurately.

### 🚩 The Problem
- **Literacy Barriers:** Complex bureaucratic forms exclude low-literacy populations.
- **Information Asymmetry:** Citizens don't know where to file or what their rights are.
- **Accountability Gap:** Individual complaints are easily ignored without community support.

### ✨ Key Features
- **Voice-First Intake:** Support for regional languages and "Hinglish" via Amazon Transcribe.
- **RAG-Powered Legal Layer:** Real-time retrieval of relevant Acts and citizen rights using Amazon OpenSearch.
- **Automated Escalation Dossier:** One-click generation of institutional-grade PDFs for unresolved issues.
- **Public Accountability Polling:** Community upvoting to highlight systemic local failures.
